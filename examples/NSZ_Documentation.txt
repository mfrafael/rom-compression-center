options
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -C                    Compress NSPXCI
  -D                    Decompress NSZXCZNCZ
  -l LEVEL, --level LEVEL
                        Compression Level Trade-off between compression speed
                        and compression ratio. Default 18, Max 22
  -L, --long            Enables zStandard long distance mode for even better
                        compression
  -B, --block           Use block compression option. This mode allows highly
                        multi-threaded compressiondecompression with random
                        read access allowing compressed games to be played
                        without decompression in the future however this comes
                        with a slightly lower compression ratio cost. This is
                        the default option for XCZ.
  -S, --solid           Use solid compression option. Slightly higher
                        compression ratio but won't allow for random read
                        access. File compressed this way will never be
                        mountable (have to be installed or decompressed first
                        to run). This is the default option for NSZ.
  -s BS, --bs BS        Block Size for random read access 2^x while x between
                        14 and 32. Default 20 = 1 MB
  -V, --verify          Verifies files after compression raising an unhandled
                        exception on hash mismatch and verify existing NSP and
                        NSZ files when given as parameter. Requires --keep
                        when used during compression.
                        NOTE Some hash checks will be skipped when processing a ticketless dump file.
  -Q, --quick-verify    Same as --verify but skips the NSP SHA256 hash
                        verification and only verifies NCA hashes. Does not
                        require --keep when used during compression.
                        NOTE Some hash checks will be skipped when processing a ticketless dump file.
  -K, --keep            Keep all useless files and partitions during
                        compression to allow bit-identical recreation
  -F, --fix-padding     Fixes PFS0 padding to match the nxdumptoolno-intro
                        standard. Incompatible with --verify so --quick-verify
                        will be used instead.
  -p, --parseCnmt       Extract TitleIdVersion from Cnmt if this information
                        cannot be obtained from the filename. Required for
                        skippingoverwriting existing files and --rm-old-
                        version to work properly if some not every file is
                        named properly. Supported filenames
                        TitleID[vVersion]
  -P, --alwaysParseCnmt
                        Always extract TitleIdVersion from Cnmt and never
                        trust filenames
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to compress with. Numbers  1
                        corresponds to the number of logical CPU cores for
                        block compression and 3 for solid compression
  -m MULTI, --multi MULTI
                        Executes multiple compression tasks in parallel. Take
                        a look at available RAM especially if compression
                        level is over 18.
  -o [OUTPUT], --output [OUTPUT]
                        Directory to save the output NSZ files
  -w, --overwrite       Continues even if there already is a file with the
                        same name or title id inside the output directory
  -r, --rm-old-version  Removes older versions if found
  --rm-source           Deletes source files after compressingdecompressing.
                        It's recommended to only use this in combination with
                        --verify
  -i, --info            Show info about title or file
  --depth DEPTH         Max depth for file info and extraction
  -x, --extract         Extract a NSPXCINSZXCZNSPZ
  --extractregex EXTRACTREGEX
                        Regex specifying which files inside the container
                        should be extracted. Example ^..(certtik)$
  --titlekeys           Extracts titlekeys from your NSPNSZ files and adds
                        missing keys to .titlekeys.txt and JSON files inside
                        .titledb (obtainable from
                        httpsgithub.comblawartitledb).
                        NOTE This parameter has no effect when processing a ticketless dump file.
  --undupe              Deleted all duplicates (games with same ID and
                        Version). The Files folder will get parsed in order so
                        the later in the argument list the more likely the
                        file is to be deleted
  --undupe-dryrun       Shows what files would get deleted using --undupe
  --undupe-rename       Renames files to minimal standard
                        [TitleId][vVersion].nsz
  --undupe-hardlink     Hardlinks files to minimal standard
                        [TitleId][vVersion].nsz
  --undupe-prioritylist UNDUPE_PRIORITYLIST
                        Regex specifying which dublicate deletion should be
                        prioritized before following the normal deletion
                        order. Example ^..(nspxci)$
  --undupe-whitelist UNDUPE_WHITELIST
                        Regex specifying which dublicates should under no
                        circumstances be deleted. Example ^..(nszxcz)$
  --undupe-blacklist UNDUPE_BLACKLIST
                        Regex specifying which files should always be deleted
                        - even if they are not even a dublicate! Be careful!
                        Example ^..(nspxci)$
  --undupe-old-versions
                        Removes every old version as long there is a newer one
                        of the same titleID.
  -c CREATE, --create CREATE
                        Inverse of --extract. Repacks filesfolders to an NSP.
                        Example --create out.nsp .in
  --machine-readable    Restricts terminal output and reports in a way that
                        is easier for a machine to read.
