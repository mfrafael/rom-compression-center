# DATA HOARDING

DATA HOARDING is a collection of utilities designed to optimize, manage, and work with data files efficiently. Each function within the DATA HOARDER project serves a specific purpose related to data manipulation, organization, or optimization.

## ROMBO (Recompression Bulk Optimizer)

ROMBO is a utility within the DATA HOARDER project specifically designed for optimizing the compression of ROM files used in gaming emulation. It compresses ROM files and folders using the 7-Zip compression algorithm, aiming to reduce file size while maintaining data integrity.

### Features:

- Compresses ROM files and folders using the LZMA2 compression algorithm.
- Skips specified folders for exclusion from compression.
- Calculates compression rates to evaluate the effectiveness of compression.
- Extracts .zip files within the ROM folder for further processing.
- Provides options for recursive compression across multiple subfolders.

## LIST ROMS

The LIST ROMS script is a utility within the DATA HOARDER project designed to list and catalog ROM files from various gaming platforms. It scans the specified ROMs directory, identifies ROM files with supported extensions (.rom, .iso, .7z, .rvz, .lnk, .wua), and creates a CSV file containing details about each ROM, such as the platform, game name, and file path.

### Features:

- Lists ROM files from specified folders within the ROMs directory.
- Supports various gaming platforms and file formats.
- Generates a CSV file with ROM details for easy cataloging and organization.

# Future functions may include:

## Data Analyzer

Data Analyzer is a utility designed to analyze and visualize data trends, patterns, and anomalies within datasets. It provides statistical analysis tools, data visualization techniques, and anomaly detection algorithms to help users gain insights from their data.

## File Organizer

File Organizer is a utility for automatically organizing files and folders based on user-defined rules and criteria. It can sort and categorize files into designated folders, rename files according to specified patterns, and remove duplicates to maintain a tidy file system.

## Backup Manager

Backup Manager is a utility for creating and managing data backups efficiently. It offers options for scheduling automatic backups, incremental backups to save storage space, and restoring data from backups when needed.

## Usage

To use ROMBO or any other function within the DATA HOARDER project, simply follow the instructions provided in the respective function's README file. Each function will have its own set of usage guidelines and instructions tailored to its specific purpose.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the README file of each function.
